// remark-math (v6) only renders math as a centered .katex-display block when the
// `$$` fence sits on its own lines. But agents emit display math three other ways:
// single-line `$$…$$`, and LaTeX `\[…\]`; inline math as `\(…\)`. Rewrite all of
// them to the forms remark-math understands so every formula renders, and display
// math actually displays. Code stays verbatim — fenced/inline code is split out
// first so a backslash-paren inside a snippet (e.g. a regex) is never touched.

// Taken from baton (`components/math-normalize.ts`), which is byte-for-byte the

// an identical solution is the strongest evidence available that it is settled;
// improving on it here would only mean diverging from both.

// Capture fenced (``` / ~~~) and inline (`…`) code so split() keeps them as
// odd-indexed segments, leaving prose on the even indices.
